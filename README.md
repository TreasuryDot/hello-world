Public owned government policy creation, endorsement and management capability.  A system to improve existing government process.  As a user I can create a policy that is considered for inclusion in the government system.  As a user I can vote on policy that I believe should be implemented in my society.  As a user I can recommend changes to existing policy.  As a user I can vote for recommended changes to existing policy.  As a user I have access to the cost and revenue associated to existing government policies.
This would ulitmately replace the existing corrupt system that is in place.
